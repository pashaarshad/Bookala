Quick steps to install APK on your Android phone

1) Build the APK
   - Run the script: BUILD_APK.bat (from this folder) or:
     C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter.bat build apk --release

2) Locate the APK
   - The debug/release APK is at:\n     build\\app\\outputs\\flutter-apk\\app-release.apk

3) Install to phone (Option A - copy & open):
   - Copy the APK to your phone (USB / cloud)
   - On the phone, navigate to the APK using a file manager and tap to install
   - You may need to allow "Install unknown apps" for the installer app (Settings)

4) Install to phone (Option B - ADB):
   - Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on the phone
   - Connect phone via USB
   - From your PC run:
     adb devices
     adb install -r build\\app\\outputs\\flutter-apk\\app-release.apk

5) Run the app on the phone and grant SMS permissions when prompted.

Notes:
- For actual SMS sending use a real Android device (emulator can't send SMS to real numbers).
- If installation fails, check Android SDK / platform-tools (adb) are installed and on PATH.
